# 🚦 Fake Number Plate Registration and Traffic Rules Violation System

## 📌 Project Description
The **Fake Number Plate Registration and Traffic Rules Violation System** is a software application designed to detect fake or unregistered vehicle number plates and monitor traffic rule violations. The system helps traffic authorities verify vehicle registrations, track violations, and maintain structured records using database and automation techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect fake or invalid vehicle number plates  
- Monitor traffic rule violations efficiently  
- Maintain centralized violation and vehicle records  
- Assist traffic authorities in enforcement operations  

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Fake number plates and traffic violations pose serious risks to public safety and law enforcement. Manual verification of vehicle details is inefficient and prone to errors. This project aims to automate number plate verification and violation tracking using a structured database-driven approach.

---

## ⚙️ System Workflow
1. Vehicle number plate is captured or entered  
2. Plate number is verified against the registration database  
3. System identifies fake or unregistered plates  
4. Traffic rule violations are recorded  
5. Violation details are stored and managed centrally

## 🔐 Features
- Fake number plate detection  
- Traffic violation monitoring  
- Centralized database management  
- Secure and role-based access  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) using ML  
- Real-time camera integration  
- E-challan generation  
- Mobile application for traffic officers
